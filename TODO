This is not an official TODO.
Some of the items addressed are already resolved.

- Get feedback from 3rd party users.
- Reviewed by Mike Snitzer.
- Audit userspace interfaces to make sure they are sane.
  Should use the same approach that is proven successful.
- Fix document.
- Add more comments inline to explain what it does and how it works.
- Refactor recover_cache() to make it readable.
- barrier_deadline_ms is zero to flush immediately.
- rambuf pool size should be configurable. Possible?
- rambuf pool should be mempool?
-- It is not just a mempool. Each has completion.
-- But we have still hope.
   Maybe `mempool_create` can accept allo_fn that
   and we can define initialization of the object there.
- RAM bufffer pool resizable if possible (low prio).
- Run on Raspberry Pi and write report (low prio)
- modulator daemon repeat stop/restart in flakey crash test
  while other daemons don't. This is not a bad behavior but
  need to elucidate.
