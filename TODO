TODO:
    - Get feedback from 3rd party users.
    - Reviewed by Mike Snitzer.
    - Audit userspace interfaces to make sure they are sane.
      Should use the same approach that is proven successful.
    - Fix document.
    - Add more comments inline to explain what it does and how it works.
    - Rename struct arr
    -- Renamed to bigarray. I don't know if it's appropriate.
    - Refactor recover_cache() to make it readable.
    - flush daemon should sleep by schedule_timeout_interruptile
      to remove flush_wait_queue?
    - barrier_deadline_ms is zero to flush immediately.
    - cache_nr should be removed. more clear to use u32 directory.
    - rambuf pool size should be configurable.
    - rambuf pool should be mempool?
    -- It is not just a mempool. Each has completion.
    -- But we have still hope.
       Maybe `mempool_create` can accept allo_fn that
       and we can define initialization of the object there.
    - RAM bufffer pool resizable if possible (low priority).
    - nr_segments, nr_rambuf_pool should be u32.
    - lap to u64?
    -- CAN NOT. metablock_device should be less than 14 bytes
    - block up in I/O error.
    -- print process id when blockup?
    - compile in 32 bit env.
    - should wait "un"interruptible on blockup
    - Run on Raspberry Pi and write report.
