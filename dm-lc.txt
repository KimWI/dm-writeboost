dm-lc
=====

dm-lc provides write-back log-structured caching.

1. Setup
========

dm-lc is composed of two target_type lc and lc-mgr.
lc is responsible for creating cached volume and controlling ios and 
lc-mgr is reponsible for managing
formatting/initializing/destructing cache devices.
Operating dm-lc through these native interfaces are not recommended.

To safely get started with dm-lc, nice userland tools are provided in
https://github.com/akiradeveloper/dm-lc
where you are also accesible to portable dm-lc kernel code
that supports since 3.2 until before dm-lc staged upstream.
please git clone it.

To install the tools,
move under Admin directory and run
python setup.py install
and you are dm-lc admin.

2. Example scripts
==================
Let's create a virtual volume named myLV
backed by /dev/myBacking
and use /dev/myCache as cache device.

myLV -- (backing) /dev/myBacking
     -- (cache)   /dev/myCache

# Step 1:
Format the cache device and
resume the device.

resuming constructs in-memory structures like hashtables
from the metadata on the cache device.

lc-format-cache /dev/myCache
lc-resume 1 /dev/myCache

# Step 2:
Create a virtual volume and
attach to the cache device.

lc-create myLV 1 /dev/myBacking
lc-attach 1 1

lc-daemon start

3. Sysfs
========
dm-lc provides several sysfs interfaces
to control the behavior.
