Hi, DM Guys.
Let me talk about the recent updates on dm-lc,
a kernel module which I announced you in the previous post.

Again, the code is currently managed in my Github repo.
https://github.com/akiradeveloper/dm-lc
See Quick Start in README which will guide you
to see what happens using dm-lc.


There are two major updates I want to mention:

(1) Introduction Slide
dm-lc has now 3k LOC that is not a minites work to understand.

To help you understand dm-lc in terms of
  (a) The overall architecure
  (b) The major features that dm-lc provides

I wrote an introduction slide which is available in URL below:
https://github.com/akiradeveloper/dm-lc/blob/develop/what-is-dm-lc.pdf

That's a nice slide with lot of figures
which I want you guys to read at first.


(2) [New Feature] Improving migration performance by "Batched Migration"
dm-lc's logging unit is called "segment".
After flushing logs, there are many dirty segments on the cache device
that will be migrated to the backing store.

Migrating number of segments simultaneously
can produce many writes to the backing store 
which are likely to be merged in I/O scheduler than
migrating them one by one.

This feature is explained in above slide.
I hope you to read that.

Thank you for reading.
Any comments about dm-lc is welcome.

Regards,
Akira
